        #   - .info - An array of the information of that unit from Juju
        #   - .file(PATH) - Get the details of a file on that unit
        #   - .file_contents(PATH) - Get plain text output of PATH file from that unit
        #   - .directory(PATH) - Get details of directory
        #   - .directory_contents(PATH) - List files and folders in PATH on that unit
        #   - .relation(relation, service:rel) - Get relation data from return service
        #          add tests here to confirm service is up and working properly

        #     page = requests.get('http://{}'.format(self.unit.info['public-address']))
